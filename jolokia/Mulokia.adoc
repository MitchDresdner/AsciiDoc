A fast easy guide to integrating Mule ESB with the https://jolokia.org/[Jolokia] monitoring agent.

Monitoring made simple with Jolokia Mule plugin


== Summary

Monitoring is an essential component for ensuring the proper functioning of Microservices. As the complexity of software systems increases, it becomes more difficult to understand performance characteristics and to troubleshoot problems. The monitoring tools we use may also need to be adaptible to new deployment strategies and environments.

Jolokia is a JMX-HTTP bridge giving an alternative to JSR-160 connectors. It's an agent based approach with support for many platforms. In addition to basic JMX operations it enhances JMX remoting with unique features like bulk requests and fine grained security policies.

This paper describes how we might utilize Open Source Jolokia as a monitoring agent for Mule. The Mule ESB has historically used the Mule Management Console (MMC) to monitor internal flow and performance characteristics.

As we start pushing out the Mule runtime as a container based solution, we'll need to give careful thought to an appropriate monitoring strategy. Here we'll consider one, the Jolokia JMX Mule Agent plugin.

<<<

== Architecture

The Jolokia client runs as a browser based instance from a Jar implemenmtation to
communicate with the monitoring server we'll embed in the Mule runtime. The
Jolokia Agent is able to communicate over various protocols such as RMI, SOAP
and JMX depicted in the diagram below.

[.text-center]
image::JolokiaArchitecture.png[JolokiaArchitecture,483,400]

Mule monitoring information, propertied and statistics will be made available to the
Jolokia Client through JMX Managed Beans (MBeans). The details are important if you
plan to expose custom monitoring data to your clients.

For more information on how to customize your data see the https://jolokia.org/documentation.html[Jokokia Documentation].


<<<

== Installation

This installation will require two parts, the Jolokia Agent which we'll embed in the Mule Runtime and
a client piece which will use Hawtio to provide browser access to the Jolokia agent.

=== Embedding Jolokia in Mule


NOTE: Start by downloading the Agent - https://jolokia.org/download.html[Jolokia Mule Download]


The snapshot below shows the latest version I had pulled for this article, if the version has changed
since then, download the latest version.

{sp} +
{sp} +

After downloading the Jolokia Mule Agent jar file, it needs to be stored in the Mule installation root folder, in $MULE_HOME/lib/opt/.
{sp} +
{sp} +

Next we'll embed the Jolokia Agent into the Mule default stub. Using your favorite editor go ahead
and make the changes to the _mule-config.xml_, ensure that the XML namespace is consistent with
the example.

.Add the Jolokia Agent reference to the apps/default/mule-config.xml

With the mule-config.xml file updated with the reference to the *jolokia-agent*, we can open the firewall port the agent listens on and send a request from the browser.

The procedure for opening the port will be different depending on whether your application is running in AWS, a Docker container, standalone Unix instance or your desktop/laptop.
I'll leave it as an exercise for you to solve with Google, if you really need help add a comment with your patform information and what you've tried.

=== Download Hawtio client

Use the link below to download the Hawtio Application from the link below.

NOTE: Download the http://hawt.io/getstarted/[Hawtio App]

Whew, that was easy!  Let move on to configuring and starting.

{sp} +
{sp} +

=== Configure Hawtio

Lets start by configuring a script that will start up the Hawtio. Using whatever process you use to
find your support Jars, add the Hawtio App jar you just downloaded to that location. Here's an example script I use to start
the Hawtio App:

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Hawtio batch file _hawt.bat_
[listing]
--
%echo off%
set HAWT_PATH=/Tools/Java/Jars/hawtio-app-1.5.4.jar <1>
set HAWT_PORT=8087<2>

java  -Dhawtio.proxyWhitelist=* -Dhawtio.authenticationEnabled=false -jar %HAWT_PATH% --port %HAWT_PORT%
--
<1> I keep my non Maven/Gradle service Jars in c:\Tools\java\Jars, you can use Unix file path naming conventions and Java will find them
<2> Pick a free port number for Jetty to use for the Hawtio application

These same notes apply to the Bash script for Unix users below.


.Hawtio script file _hawt_
[listing]
--
#!/bin/bash
export HAWT_PATH=$HOME/Java/Jars/hawtio-app-1.5.4.jar
export HAWT_PORT=8087

java  -Dhawtio.proxyWhitelist=* -Dhawtio.authenticationEnabled=false -jar $HAWT_PATH --port $HAWT_PORT
--



<<<

== Starting Hawtio

Hawtio will start up a Jetty server on the port you specified in the configuration, then
it will start a browser session connecting to the startup URI.

.Run your script

The *Welcome* page serves to get beginners oriented with Hawtio, click on the *Connect* menu option.

If your Mule instance isn't local, be sure to enter the Domain Name or IP address and make sure port 8899 is open on the Mule host.

Now for the fun part, when your connection request succeeds, you'll get a new brwoser display like this:

Hawtio supports various plugins that you can add to the application. Feel free to explore the various menu options and get
familiar with all the capabilities.

I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I have enjoyed writing it, i'm looking forward to your comments!
