Enabling Basic Authentication in your json-server

{sp} +

Simple approach for adding authentication to your requests

== Summary

In my last DZone article on https://dzone.com/articles/zero-code-rest-with-json-server[Zero Code REST with json-server] I showed you how to
standup a REST server with minimal effort and _no coding_.

While this approach may work well in many situations, you often find that you'll to need extend capabilities, so you'll soon roll up you sleves
and start bending some code. The fun stuff!

This article will share an approach for adding authentication to https://github.com/typicode/json-server[json-server] using a simple, unobtrusive
Express middleware component called http://www.passportjs.org/[Passport].

<<<

== Architecture

Most sites require users to register and then use their credentials for access. Passport provides the layers necessary for authenticating
claims made by users logging in to the site.

image:Passport-Auth.png[User Registration]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[Basic Authentication] is the simplest form of authenticating users, consisting of a
user name and a secret password. Being the simplest, it's arguably also the weakest form and vulnerable to intercept and exploitation when
not used with secure transports.

The intent of this article is to share how we can start moving from plain text unauthenticated methods of communicating with our json-server to
more robust solutions. Passport provides an extensible set of plugins known as _strategies_ which will help you to do just that. At the time of
this writing there are nearly 500 authentication strategies to choose from including:

- Basic Authentication
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Google
- LinkedIn

Strategies can range from verifying username and password credentials, delegated authentication using http://oauth.net/[OAuth] (using http://www.facebook.com/[Facebook]
or http://twitter.com/[Twitter]), or federated authentication using http://openid.net/[OpenID].

== Passport Strategy

Passport strategies are generally of the following form:

.Example Passport Strategy
[listing]
----
passport.use(new Strategy(
  function(username, password, cb) { <1>
    db.users.findByUsername(username, function(err, user) { <2>
      if (err) { return cb(err); } <3>
      if (!user) { return cb(null, false); } <4>
      if (user.password != password) { return cb(null, false); } <5>
      return cb(null, user);
    });
  }));
----
<1> Authentication credentials
<2> Callback to verify access
<3> Error handling
<4> User Verification
<5> Password authentication

{sp} +
{sp} +

We'll now integrate passport authentication with the json-server we created in the last article.

{sp} +

CAUTION: For the sake of brevity and focusing on authentication, this example doesn't use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[TLS] as any real world application should.

{sp} +
{sp} +


== Configuring  User Authentication

Passport author Jared Hanson, provides us with many a good examples of Strategy implementation, as
good OO practitioners we'll follow the mantra to _reuse_ rather than _reinvent_,
leveraging his https://github.com/passport/express-3.x-http-basic-example[Basic Authentication example].
{sp} +
{sp} +

Our new folder hierarchy now includes a _db_ folder, simulating a database containing authentication
credentials.

];

exports.findByUsername = function(username, cb) {
  process.nextTick(function() {
    for (var i = 0, len = records.length; i < len; i++) {
      var record = records[i];
      if (record.username === username) {
        return cb(null, record);
      }
    }
    return cb(null, null);
  });
}

== Configuring  NPM packaging

In our earlier Zero Code example, we were able to start the json-server with static
assets in our project hierarchy. As we add custom code we'll need a way of leting NPM
know about our project dependencies. This is accomplished by adding _package.json_.

.package.json
[listing]
--
{
  "name": "custom-json-server",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Custom json-server",
  "main": "server.js",
  "dependencies": {
    "json-server": "^0.12.1",     <1>
    "passport": "^0.2.2",         <2>
    "passport-http": "^0.3.0"     <
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "json-server": "^0.12.1"

  },
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "node server.js --watch ./json/db.json",   <3>
    "test":       "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
    "json",
    "api"
  ],
  "author": "M. Dresdner",
  "license": "MIT"
}
--
<1> json-server dependencies
<2> Passport dependencies
<3> Script for starting our server


{sp} +
{sp} +

After creating the _package.json_ we'll need to install the required packages. This is
accomplished by running the _npm install_ command or the short form _npm i_.

.npm install
[listing]
--
npm i
--

You should see npm pull down all the required packages and save them into folder _node_modules_.

With json-server and passport packages installed we turn our attention toward creating our
custom code _json-server_.

== Configuring Server.json

Our customized rendition of json-server allows for additional middleware products in our
json-server implementation. To add the _Basic Authentication_ support, we start with the
sample code described in the _Module_ section of the https://github.com/typicode/json-server[json-server]
website and add our references to Passport.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.server.json
[listing]
--
const jsonServer = require('json-server')
const server = jsonServer.create()
const path = require('path')
const router = jsonServer.router(path.join(__dirname, './json/db.json'))

const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults()

var passport = require('passport');   <1>
var Strategy = require('passport-http').BasicStrategy;
var db = require('./db/index');


// Configure the Basic strategy for use by Passport.    <2>
passport.use(new Strategy(
  function(username, password, cb) {
    db.users.findByUsername(username, function(err, user) {
      if (err) { return cb(err); }
      if (!user) { return cb(null, false); }
      if (user.password != password) { return cb(null, false); }
      return cb(null, user);
    });
  }));

// http -a jack:secret localhost:3000/email     <3>
server.get('/email',
  passport.authenticate('basic', { session: false }),
  function(req, res) {
    res.json({ username: req.user.username, email: req.user.emails[0].value });
  });


// Create a new Express application.
//var app = express();

server.use(middlewares)


// http localhost:3000/wines
server.use(router)
server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('JSON Server is running on 3000')
})
--
<1> Bring in Passport support
<2> configure our Basic Authentication strategy
<3> Add a new Express handler for authenticating a new request

{sp} +
{sp} +

With the integration of Passport with json-server complete,  Passport should now be configured to validate a new route request to _/email_.

Let's start up the json server and see if we broke anything in our latest refactorings.

.start json-server
[listing]
--
npm run serve
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

Since we now have a custom json-server implementation, we start it using the script (above)
that we added earlier in our _package.json_.

When the json-server starts you see the message _JSON Server is running on 3000_.

We can now send some test messages with _httpie_.

{sp} +
{sp} +


.Regression testing
[listing]
--
http localhost:3000/wines
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

If all went well you should see the familiar response to _all wines_ from json-server.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Authentication test
[listing]
--
http -a jack:secret localhost:3000/email
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

If all went well you should see the following response -

.Authentication response
[listing]
--
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 55
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2018 18:06:27 GMT
ETag: W/"37-lew270BaMoufxDP6PMJe/Pp2Pys"
X-Powered-By: Express

{
    "email": "jack@example.com",
    "username": "jack"
}

--

{sp} +
{sp} +

Next, well mess with the password and try again.

.Authentication failure
[listing]
--
http -a jack:Xsecret localhost:3000/email
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

As expected we get an authentication failure.

.Authentication failure response
[listing]
--
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 12
Date: Mon, 30 Apr 2018 18:08:45 GMT
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Users"
X-Powered-By: Express

Unauthorized

That was useful and a bit of fun, for your next steps I expect you may want to try another _Passport Strategy_ like
_Google_ or _LinkedIn_ authentication!

Passport's pluggable authentication greatly simplifies a complex, arduous and oft times error prone process.

I hope you've enjoyed reading this article as much as I have writing it and am looking forward to your feedback.
