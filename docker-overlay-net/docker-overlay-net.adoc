Creating an overlay network for standalone containers

[.preamble]
// Preamble goes here


image::under-construction.jpg[Containers in action,700]

== Summary

When we get started using Docker, the typical configuration is to create a standalone application on our desktop.

For the most part, it's usually not practical to run all your applications on a single machine and when it's not you'll need
an approach for distributing the applications across many machines. This is where a Docker Swarm comes in.

Docker Swarm provides capabilities for clustering, scalability, discovery and security to name a few. In this
article, we'll create a basic Swarm configuration and perform some experiments to illustrate discovery and connectivity.

The demo Swarm cluster will consist of a Swarm manager and two workers, for convenience it will be running in AWS.

{sp} +

[NOTE]
====
_If you feel you're in need of a refresher on Docker Swarm or configuring your AWS account see https://dzone.com/articles/fun-with-docker-swarm[Dzone article: Fun with Docker Swarm] here._

{sp} +

== Architecture

Our target Architecture will consist of deploying Mule applications from AnypointStudio into Docker containers running inside an AWS AMI image.

{sp} +

image::under-construction.jpg[Mule in AWS,540]

{sp} +

In the steps below you'll configure an AWS EC2 instance and configure the environment for Docker. With Docker installed you'll
create images for Mule and MMC, run the containers, associate the Mule runtime with the MMC and deploy a simple _Hello Mule_ application.

Docker containers are ephemeral by nature, which means that any changes to container state will be lost when a container is
stopped. This isn't desirable and a quick remedy will be to use Docker volumes to persist and changes we need between container
starts. The information which will be stateful is specified by the *VOLUME* tag in the Docker files below.

{sp} +

== Prerequisites

We assume you're somewhat familiar with Docker and have some familiarity setting up EC2 instances in AWS.

If you're not confident with AWS or would like a little refresher please review the following articles:

{sp} +

.Some refreshers before getting started
* https://dzone.com/articles/provision-a-free-aws-ec2-instance-in-5-minutes[Provision a free tier EC2 instance]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/#cloud[Configure Docker on your EC2 instance]

=== Caveats
[CAUTION]
--
Some AWS services will incur charges, be sure to stop and/or terminate any services you aren't using. Additionaly,
consider setting up https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2012/05/10/announcing-aws-billing-alerts/[billing alerts]
to warn you of charges exceeding a threshold that may caus you concern.

--

== Configuration

Begin by creating (3) EC2 instances, free tier should be fine, and install Docker on each EC2 instance.
Refer to the https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms[Docker Supported platforms] section for
guidance and instructions for your instance.


In my EC2-User home folder I use the following hierarchy for my Dockerfile source:

Note that the tar file has been expanded and we have a folder for *mule-enterprise-standalone-3.9.0*.

The reason for this is that I install our custom EE license, make any changes to configuration files
unique to our environments and repackage the tar file for creation of the Mule Docker image.

The Docker volumes expect to preserve stateful information under /opt, so the folder
structure and permissions will need to be set up. My permissions are wide open, you
may prefer to create an EC2 Mule user and group to apply stricter access control. If
you do i'm confident you'll do so successfully on your own.

== Dockerizing the Mule Management Console (MMC)


.Dockerfile for MMC
[listing]
--
FROM java:openjdk-8-jdk

MAINTAINER Your Name <me@myaddress.com>

USER root

WORKDIR /opt
RUN useradd --user-group --shell /bin/false mule && chown mule /opt

COPY    ./mmc-3.8.x-web.tar.gz /opt
COPY    ./start.sh /opt

# Using the most recent MMC 3.8.x version
RUN		tar xzf mmc-3.8.x-web.tar.gz \
		  && ln -s mmc-3.8.x-web mmc \
		  && chmod 755 mmc-3.8.x-web \
		  && chmod 755 start.sh \
		  && rm mmc-3.8.x-web.tar.gz

# Mule environment vars
ENV MMC_HOME /opt/mmc

# Volume mount points
VOLUME ["/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/logs", "/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/conf", "/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/bin", "/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/mmc-data"]

# Mule work directory
# WORKDIR /opt

USER mule

# start tomcat && tail -f /var/lib/tomcat7/logs/catalina.out
CMD [ "./start.sh" ]

# Expose default MMC port
EXPOSE 8585
--

{sp} +

When the MMC Docker container starts, it will run the Tomcat server and tail the
log contents to stdout.

{sp} +

Create the _start.sh_ script below in you MMC folder, it will be added to the
Docker image and will keep the container running after it's started in the step below.

.start.sh file in MMC folder
[listing]
--
#!/bin/sh

# If the apache-tomcat location is different for you, be sre to change
cd /opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52

bin/startup.sh && tail -f logs/catalina.out
--

{sp} +
The initial build may take a while to complete as it needs to
pull down the image layers from the Docker hub and create an
image.

.Build your MMC Docker container
[listing]
--
# Change maxmule at end of next line to your Docker image name and optionally tag
docker build -t maxmule/mmc .
--

{sp} +
When the build successfully completes we can start the MMC container instance
and use the browser to connect to it.

.Run your MMC Docker container
[listing]
--
# Change maxmule at end of next line to your Docker image name
docker run -itd --name mmc -p 8585:8585 -v /opt/mmc/mmc-data:/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/mmc-data -v /opt/mmc/logs:/opt/mmc/apache-tomcat-7.0.52/logs maxmule/mmc

--
{sp} +

It may take a while for the MMC to start up, you can use the Docker
_logs_ command to see when startup has completed. The *Ctrl-C* command
will terminate the earlier logs command.

.Ensure MMC is running

docker ps

docker logs -f mmc

== Dockerizing the Mule Runtime

# Expose port 7777 if you plan to use MMC
EXPOSE 7777

# Expose additional ports as needed for your API use
#EXPOSE 8081
EXPOSE 8082
#EXPOSE 8083

--

{sp}+
Similar to how we built and started the MMC above we'll follow the same steps with our Mule container.

Mule will be using port 8082 for working with our API deployment and port 7777 for
communicating with the MMC.

.Build your Mule Docker container
[listing]
--
# Change maxmule at end of next line to your Docker image name and optionally tag
docker build -t maxmule/mule39ee .
--

{sp}+
The build step is the same as we did erlier for the MMC

.Build your Mule Docker container
[listing]
--
# Change maxmule at end of next line to your Docker image name
docker run -itd --name mule -p 8082:8082 -v /opt/mule/apps:/opt/mule/apps -v /opt/mule/logs:/opt/mule/logs maxmule/mule39ee
--

{sp} +
When build has successfully completed we run our Mule runtime instance and verify it has properly started.

.Ensure Mule is running
[listing]
--
docker ps

docker logs -f mule
^C
--

== Deploying a model

Create a simple HTTP flow in AnypointStudio which listens on Port 8082, a port which you expose in your Docker file and
the EC2 instance security group. Run the flow in AnypointStudio first to ensure it will work when deployed to your Docker container.

This concludes our brief examples with Dockerizing the Mule.
