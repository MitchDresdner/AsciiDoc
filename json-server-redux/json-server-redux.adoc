Static JSON API responses with even less minimal effort

{sp} +

An end-to-end testing framework

== Summary

In April of this year I made the case for implementing static web sites using
the https://dzone.com/articles/zero-code-rest-with-json-server[json-server and Zero coding].

While easy to use and practical, i've refactored the article to save some 90 lines of installation steps
using Docker and pre-built images courtousy of *Clue* https://github.com/clue[_aka Christian Luck_],
so _get a clue_ and lets get going!


<<<

== Architecture

The json-server is the Server side of the Client/Server Use Case, with a Client application
making HTTP requests to the Server and the json-server providing determined canned responses
or simulated errors.

When the json-server starts, it will read a database of static
JSON responses which we'll work with later using the HTTPie JSON Client.

This Use Case uses a Dockerized instance of the json-server with it's database mounted
externally in a volume share on the local filesystem. The file share is linked on my
https://cloudkul.com/blog/mounting-s3-bucket-linux-ec2-instance[EC2 instance to an S3 bucket].

== Installation

_The installation really is quite simple!_ Or, so I stated in the previous article, which hopefully
provided a better grounding in each of the steps involved. But now the refactored steps are even easier.

[source,json]
.Create HTTPie Docker instance
----
$ # add to your .bashrc file to make alias permanent
$ alias http='docker run -it --rm --net=host clue/httpie'
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

Using your favorite editor, enter the example json data below into the /data/wine.json file.

[source,json]
.db.json example data
----
{
  "wines": [
    { "id": 1, "product": "SOMMELIER SELECT",
      "desc": "Old vine Cabernet Sauvignon", "price": 159.99 },
    { "id": 2, "product": "MASTER VINTNER",
      "desc": "Pinot Noir captures luscious aromas", "price": 89.99 },
    { "id": 3, "product": "WINEMAKER'S RESERVE",
      "desc": "Merlot featuring complex flavors of cherry", "price": 84.99 },
    { "id": 4, "product": "ITALIAN SANGIOVESE",
      "desc": "Sangiovese grape is famous for its dry, bright cherry character", "price": 147.99 }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "body": "like the added grape skins", "wineId": 1 },
    { "id": 1, "body": "the directions need to be clearer", "wineId": 2 },
    { "id": 3, "body": "I received 3 different packages of wood chips", "wineId": 1 }
  ],
  "profile": { "name": "vintnor" }
}

=== Running the json-server

With our sample data created lets start playing with the json-server.

<<<

== Interactions with json-server

In this section we'll starting putting our json-server interactions into practical use.

TIP: For a refresher on the usage of *HTTP Verbs* see this https://dzone.com/articles/the-simple-guide-to-http-verbs-patch-put-and-post[DZone HTTP verbs article.]

[source,json]
.Create json-server Docker container
----
$ # run the json-server
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name json-server \
    -v /data/wine.json:/data/db.json \
    clue/json-server
----
<1> -d json-server runs in the background
<2> -p host_port_listening_for_request:80 container port
<3> -v json_db_on_host:/data.db.json in container

{sp} +
{sp} +

=== HTTPie Examples

We'll be using the HTTPie Docker container we created an alias
for earlier to send JSON messages to the json-server.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Basic example of HTTPie usage
[listing]
----
http :80/wines/1 <1>
or
http http://localhost:80/wines/1 <2>
----
<1> Short form
<2> Long form
{sp} +
{sp} +

When you invoke HTTPie using the command line, you can use the _short_ form
(leave off the *http://localhost* part of the URI), or the _long_ form
it's your choice.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a GET Request


.HTTP GET Requests
image:get-wines-1.png[Folder structure,150]


.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http /wines/1
--


GET Requests
|===
|Request |URI |Result

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines/1
|Wine with ID=1

|GET
|http :80/wines?price_gte=100
|wines with price >= 100

|GET
|http :80/wines?id_ne=2
|filter id=2

|GET
|http :80/wines?_embed=comments
|embed all comments

|GET
|http :80/wines/1?_embed=comments
|embed comments for ID=1

|===

_For more examples see the https://github.com/typicode/json-server[json-server] website_

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a POST Request

With POST we will add a new record to the database.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP POST Requests
image:post-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http POST :80/wines id=5 product="TWO BUCK CHUCK" price=2.99 desc="Squeezed rapidly from a delicate, yet unpretentious grape"
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|POST
|http POST :80/wines ... (see above)
|New wine entry with id=5

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines?desc_like=grape
|All wines with _grape_ in  desc

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a PUT Request

In our PUT example we'll make a change to *product*
for the record we just added with POST.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP PUT Requests
image:put-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http PUT :80/wines/5 product="TWO-ISH BUCK CHUCK" price=2.99 desc="Squeezed rapidly from a delicate, yet pretentious grape"
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|PUT
|http PUT :80/wines ... (see above)
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

NOTE: If you don't enter all the fields, PUT will replace with just what you provide.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Finally, a DELETE Request

To complete our example CRUD operations we'll delete the record with ID=5

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP DELETE Requests
image:delete-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http DELETE :80/wines/5
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|DELETE
|http :80/wines/5
|Deletes wine with ID=5

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

Voila, the record is gone!

There's lots more you can do with json-server including requests with additional verbs,
adding middleware to include new features, enabling complex routing rules, sorting, filtering
and much more.

I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I have writing it, I'm looking forward to your feedback.
