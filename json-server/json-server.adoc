Static JSON API responses with minimal effort

{sp} +

An end-to-end testing framework

== Summary

Time and again we find ourselves in need of standing up a JSON server
for sharing schemas with our clients while our development is
in progress or for supporting our own end-to-end testing.

When you need a fast, easy to use JSON API solution,
not many options are quick get running or as feature-rich as the
 https://github.com/typicode/json-server[json-server].


{sp} +

== Architecture

The json-server implements the client/server Use Case, with the client application
making HTTP requests to the server and the server providing determined canned responses
or simulated errors.

When the server starts it will read a database of static
JSON responses which we'll interact with later using the HTTPie JSON Client.

Another Use Case for json-server is when you're developing a new application
which depends on API's which are rate limited. One example of this is the
http://openweathermap.org/api[Open Wearther Map] api. With the free tier
you're limited to a fixed number of calls in a sliding time window. You
can capture the JSON results, add them to json-server database and play them back by
making unlimited, unbounded requests.

{sp} +

== Installation

{sp} +
{sp} +

The json-server is a JavaScript application which I hope won't scare off too
many Java or Mule developers, certainly it won't scare any polyglots! The installation really is quite simple.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.The Node Package Manager (NPM)
****
NPM is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment https://nodejs.org/en/download/[Node.js],
it consists of a command line client that interacts with a remote registry.
We'll use NPM to download and install **json-server**.

This is as simple installation if you don't already have NPM installed.

Download the latest version https://nodejs.org/en/[here]

****

{sp} +
{sp} +

With NPM installed, you can perform a global install of json-server.
The installation will add json-server to your path and allow you to run
it from a shell window.

{sp} +
{sp} +

NOTE: If this is the first time you're installing NPM you may need to open a new shell to add the new path.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Installing the JSON Server
[shell]
----
npm install -g json-server

# verify the installation was successful
json-server -v
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

== Configuring  json-server

You will need to decide where you'll keep the JSON schema database, which keeps the schema
that will be returned for client requests.

{sp} +
{sp} +

=== Sample db.json database


With json-server installed, create a folder where you plan to keep any sample data and project properties.

It's up to you where you would like to put it, I like keeping it on my
Google Drive so I can reuse it on different machines, keeping it in Git is another good solution.

{sp} +
{sp} +

[listing]
--
mkdir json-server
cd json-server
mkdir json

--

{sp} +
{sp} +

In the **json** folder create this sample **db.json** file.

When you've completed the hierarchy should look like this:

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Folder hierarchy

      "desc": "Pinot Noir captures luscious aromas", "price": 89.99 },

=== Running the json-server

With our sample data created lets start playing with the json-server.

{sp} +
{sp} +

== Interactions with json-server

In this section we'll starting putting our json-server interactions into practical use.

TIP: For a refresher on the usage of *HTTP Verbs* see this https://dzone.com/articles/the-simple-guide-to-http-verbs-patch-put-and-post[DZone article.]

From the json-server folder, run the following command:


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Getting json-server command line help
[listing]
--
json-server -h
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

As you can see there's lots of options for changing or overriding the defalut behaviors.

{sp} +
{sp} +

CAUTION: On a Unix system, change the Windows backslash "\" to a Unix forward slash "/".

{sp} +
{sp} +

When we start json-server, the default port it will listen on is 3000.
If you prefer a different port you have two options, the first is to use
the -p switch passing the new port number. You can also add a config file
which you specify the location of using the -c switch. In the examples below
we'll be using the defaults.
{sp} +
{sp} +

.Example json-server config file: json-server.json
[listing]
--
{
  "port": 9000
}
--
{sp} +
{sp} +

With the preliminaries out of the way, lets start json-server and
prepare for sending some command line requests.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Starting the json-server
[listing]
--
json-server --watch json/db.json
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

In this the first example we start the json-server asking it to
watch the file **json\db.json** for changes.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Beneath the ascii art you should see the following
[listing]
--
Loading json\db.json <1>
Done

Resources <2>
http://localhost:3000/wines
http://localhost:3000/comments
http://localhost:3000/profile

Home <3>
http://localhost:3000
--
<1> Database file **json\db.json** loaded successfully
<2> URI's for JSON resources which were loaded
<3> The URI for the default internal website (you can change this)

{sp} +
{sp} +

=== HTTPie Examples

To get started using HTTPie for the examples, you can download it
using the link below.

Feel free to use https://www.getpostman.com/[Postman] or curl from a https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git bash] terminal shell on Windows if you'de prefer.
You should be able to adapt the HTTPie examples accordingly.

https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie[HTTPie] is a https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html[curl] like command line tool which can be used from Unix and Windows.
I like it better than curl because it comes loaded with lots of syntactic sugar.

{sp} +
{sp} +

. Basic HTTPie usage
[listing]
----
http localhost:3000/wines/1
or
http http://localhost:3000/wines/1
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

Note that when HTTPie installs it will be called *http*, when you invoke it
the command line, you can use or leave off the *http://* part of the URI,
it's your choice.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Default WebSite

Lets get started by hitting the default website from your browser.

.Use browser to access website
[listing]
----
http://localhost:3000
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

Under **Resources** you notice that _vintner_ has been misspelled as _vintnor_. You fix the
typo using your favorite editor and save the file. Refreshing the link you notice that
the change has already been picked up by json-server.

Providing the **--watch* option told the json-server to run in development mode, watching
and reloading changes.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== GET Request


.HTTP GET Requests
image:get-wines-1.png[Folder structure,150]


.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http localhost:3000/wines/1
--

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== POST Request

With POST we will add a new record to the database.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP POST Requests

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman

|All wine entries

|GET
|http localhost:3000/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http localhost:3000/wines?desc_like=grape
|All wines with _grape_ in  desc

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== PUT Request

In our PUT example we'll make a change to *product*
to the record we just added with POST.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP PUT Requests

|http localhost:3000/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http localhost:3000/wines

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

NOTE: If you don't enter all the fields, PUT will replace with just what you provide.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== DELETE Request

To complete our example CRUD operations we'll delete the record with ID=5

{sp} +
{sp} +
