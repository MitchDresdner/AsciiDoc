[abstract]
This article discusses locating your  https://www.raspberrypi.org/[Raspberry Pi] without having to create a static IP address.

While using a single Pi on the same network a static IP may not be a big deal, when connecting to your Pi from differing locations or networks, using dynamic discovery similar to micro services, may be preferred.

// Preamble goes here



== Dynamic Discovery

The main reason for a static IP address is to have a known location where we can find our Raspberry Pi on the home network. At the office and on the internet a Domain Name Server (DNS) is used for converting a user friendly name, like Apple or Google, into an internet IP address, from which a network connection is established.


A similar mechanism for _Dynamic Discovery_ can be used in the home network. https://support.apple.com/downloads/bonjour_for_windows[Apple Bonjour] is a networking technology using http://zeroconf.org/[Zero Configuration] protocol on Windows and Mac OS's to discover network devices.

Bonjour is typically used in the home to permit Windows and Apple devices to share services, such as printers or multimedia devices.

On Unix OS's such as Raspian and Ubuntu the Avahi Daemon performs a similar service.

_Features of Dynamic Discovery_

* Plug-n-Play, no configuration needed
* Dynamic discovery of services
* Can coexist with heavier enterprise appliances (DNS)

== Multicast DNS

Multicast DNS (MDNS) https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6762[RFC 6762] is based on Zero Config (it just works), for service discovery. MDNS can be used standalone or together with your DNS server.

Discovery is accomplished when a host sends a multicast query to the network looking for services, multicast responses are sent back which are used by listeners to update their local cache.

For Raspberry Pi discovery, our interest is in finding the hostnames of our SSH daemon so we can connect without a static IP address.

== Bonjour Discovery on Windows

Device discovery using the https://hobbyistsoftware.com/bonjourbrowser[Windows Bonjour Browser]

=== Using Windows CMD tool for multicast DNS discovery

First we browse for service instances which respond to MDNS discovery of interest to us is https://developer.apple.com/library/content/qa/qa1312/_index.html[SSH discovery] to assist in connecting with our Raspberry Pi.
[source,ruby]
dns-sd -B  _udisks-ssh._tcp

A lookup can also be performed for workstation
[source,ruby]
dns-sd -B _workstation._tcp

Next we perform a lookup on the service instance
[source,ruby]
dns-sd -L guava _udisks-ssh._tcp


[source,ruby]
dns-sd -B _services._dns-sd._udp

=== Connecting to your Pi from windows
If you have Git installed you can use the Git BASH shell to connect to your discovered instances
[source,ruby]
ssh pi@guava.local


== Avahi Discovery on Raspian

On Raspian and Ubuntu you'll want to ensure that the http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man1/avahi-browse.1.html[Avahi Browse] package has been installed
[source,ruby]
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libnss-mdns avahi-utils

Similar to the Windows example above, we can use Avahi Browse to search for our Raspberry Pi's
[source,ruby]
avahi-browse _services._dns-sd._udp -t
avahi-browse -r -t _udisks-ssh._tcp

Connecting from Linux as you usually do.
[source,ruby]
ssh pi@guava.local
