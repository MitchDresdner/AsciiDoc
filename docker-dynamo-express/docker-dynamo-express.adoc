== Summary

In my April article I demonstrated the ease of implementing a REST server using
the https://dzone.com/articles/zero-code-rest-with-ExpressJS server[ExpressJS server and Zero coding].

While easy to use and practical, it probably won't be long before you get to the point of wanting
more in the way of custom routing and stateful database operations. In this article we'll explore using
DynamoDB in a Docker container to persist REST CRUD messages routed using ExpressJS.

<<<

== Architecture

ExpressJS is fulfilling the Server role of the Client/Server Use Case, with a HttpIE Client
making REST requests to the Server and the ExpressJS server persisting JSON messages to DynamoDB
and returning responses or errors. This is the typical pattern for most API's.

The DynamoDB docker instance allows you to experiment with DynamoDB outside of AWS and not
incur any cost. It's intended as a sandbox demonstration environment only, you should deploy
to and AWS instance for any live production applications.

You'll be sending the basic REST messages (POST, PUT, GET and DELETE) to Express which will route
the Create, Update, Delete and Display components to and from the HttpIE client application. This example
will provide the basics from which many real world applications can be modelled from.

== Skills

In the examples which follow you'll be installing a DynamoDB container so you'll be expected to have
a Docker configuration you can run the container from and a basic understanding of working with
Docker.

A basic understanding of AWS and DynamoDB will be helpful.

You'll also be creating a simple server using ExpressJS and will need to have Node/NPM installed and it
would be good to have a working knowledge of the same. I'm working with the most current version v8.12.0,
but it's possible that lower versions may work.

To send JSON CRUD commands to our ExpressJS server i'll be using HttpIE, but if you prefer Postman or CURL
the examples should be easy to translate. If you would need some help installing Node/NPM and HttpIE please
refer to my earlier DZone article https://dzone.com/articles/zero-code-rest-with-ExpressJS server[ExpressJS server and Zero coding].

== Installation

The DynamoDB Docker container we'll be using is the https://hub.docker.com/r/dwmkerr/dynamodb/[Kerr edition found here].
It has a browser interface with an interactive terminal for playing with DynamoDB. It also supports a volume
share for persisting content, otherwise the data is ephemeral.

[source,json]
.Install/Start your DynamoDB container
----
$ # add to your .bashrc file to make alias permanent
$ docker run -p 8000:8000 dwmkerr/dynamodb
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

If you don't already have an AWS account you might consider signing up for one. As you're running
DynamoDB as a container service it appears that your credentials aren't strictly required, but are
a dependence in the AWS SDK which we'll be using for DynamoDB access. The following link describes the
configurations for https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html[AWS Credentials].

If I spoof my password, the DynamoDB login still works, but if I rename the config or credentials file
I get an exception, so it's possible you can play with the examples without an account, but the strategy is not
practical if you plan to take next steps with DynamoDB.

Create a directory for the ExpressJS project and run _npm init_ to initialize the package.json file.

[source,json]
.Create your ExpressJS project
----
$ mkdir mydynamo
$ cd mydynamo
$ npm init -y
----

{sp} +
{sp} +

Using your favorite editor, create the package.json data below in your project folder.

[source,json]
.package.json example
----
{
  "name": "test-setup",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "list-tables.js",
  "scripts": {
    "list": "node list-tables.js",
    "load": "node MoviesLoadData.js",
    "q1": "node MoviesQuery01.js",
    "q2": "node MoviesQuery02.js",
    "scan": "node MoviesScan.js",
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "aws-sdk": "^2.339.0"
  }
}

To help minimize the amount of code we'll need for the examples, we'll be reusing the Movie Sample code
and data from the AWS DynamoDB developer guide. Here's a list of the examples to add to the project.

|===
|Source File |Location |Description

|MoviesCreateTable.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.01.html
|Creates the DynamoDB table needed for the examples

|MoviesLoadData.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.02.html
|Install sample data into DynamoDB

|MoviesQuery01.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.04.html
|Query all movies released in a specified year

|MoviesQuery02.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.04.html
|Query by title, all movies released in a specified year

|MoviesScan.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.04.html
|Scans all table data, qualified by a filter

|MoviesDeleteTable.js
|https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GettingStarted.NodeJs.05.html
|Delete sample data table

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

Download the sample data to your project.

[source,json]
.Download moviedata.json
----
$ http --download https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/samples/moviedata.zip
----

Unzip the moviedata.json file into the project folder, you can remove the zip file afterward.

=== Create table and install sample data

The package.json file is scripted to create, delete, query and load the sample data.

[source,json]
.Create database
----
$ npm run create
----

Next load the sample data

[source,json]
.Load the sample data
----
$ npm run load
----

Run a sample query

[source,json]
.Query the DynamoDB table
----
$ npm run q1
----

=== Create the ExpressJS API's

Add the following code to you project for handling JSON requests.

=== Running the ExpressJS server

With our sample data created lets start playing with the ExpressJS server.

<<<

== Interactions with ExpressJS server

In this section we'll starting putting our  interactions into practical use.

TIP: For a refresher on the usage of *HTTP Verbs* see this https://dzone.com/articles/the-simple-guide-to-http-verbs-patch-put-and-post[DZone HTTP verbs article.]

[source,json]
.Create ExpressJS server Docker container
----
$ # run the ExpressJS server
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 --name ExpressJS server \
    -v /data/wine.json:/data/db.json \
    clue/ExpressJS server
----
<1> -d ExpressJS server runs in the background
<2> -p host_port_listening_for_request:80 container port
<3> -v json_db_on_host:/data.db.json in container

{sp} +
{sp} +

=== HTTPie Examples

We'll be using the HTTPie Docker container we created an alias
for earlier to send JSON messages to the ExpressJS server.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.Basic example of HTTPie usage
[listing]
----
http :80/wines/1 <1>
or
http http://localhost:80/wines/1 <2>
----
<1> Short form
<2> Long form
{sp} +
{sp} +

When you invoke HTTPie using the command line, you can use the _short_ form
(leave off the *http://localhost* part of the URI), or the _long_ form
it's your choice.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a GET Request


.HTTP GET Requests
image:get-wines-1.png[Folder structure,150]


.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http /wines/1
--


GET Requests
|===
|Request |URI |Result

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines/1
|Wine with ID=1

|GET
|http :80/wines?price_gte=100
|wines with price >= 100

|GET
|http :80/wines?id_ne=2
|filter id=2

|GET
|http :80/wines?_embed=comments
|embed all comments

|GET
|http :80/wines/1?_embed=comments
|embed comments for ID=1

|===

_For more examples see the https://github.com/typicode/ExpressJS server[ExpressJS server] website_

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a POST Request

With POST we will add a new record to the database.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP POST Requests
image:post-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http POST :80/wines id=5 product="TWO BUCK CHUCK" price=2.99 desc="Squeezed rapidly from a delicate, yet unpretentious grape"
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|POST
|http POST :80/wines ... (see above)
|New wine entry with id=5

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines?desc_like=grape
|All wines with _grape_ in  desc

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Making a PUT Request

In our PUT example we'll make a change to *product*
for the record we just added with POST.

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP PUT Requests
image:put-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http PUT :80/wines/5 product="TWO-ISH BUCK CHUCK" price=2.99 desc="Squeezed rapidly from a delicate, yet pretentious grape"
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|PUT
|http PUT :80/wines ... (see above)
|All wine entries

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

NOTE: If you don't enter all the fields, PUT will replace with just what you provide.

{sp} +
{sp} +

==== Finally, a DELETE Request

To complete our example CRUD operations we'll delete the record with ID=5

{sp} +
{sp} +

.HTTP DELETE Requests
image:delete-wines.png[Folder structure,150]


{sp} +
{sp} +

.Use HTTPie, curl or postman
[listing]
--
http DELETE :80/wines/5
--


|===

|Request |URI |Result

|DELETE
|http :80/wines/5
|Deletes wine with ID=5

|GET
|http :80/wines
|All wine entries

|===

{sp} +
{sp} +

Voila, the record is gone!

There's lots more you can do with ExpressJS server including requests with additional verbs,
adding middleware to include new features, enabling complex routing rules, sorting, filtering
and much more.
